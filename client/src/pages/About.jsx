          Testing and diagnosis make up about 50% of the medical sector. While
          testing for various diseases is very important, we must always seek
          the assistance of a medical professional when results are received.
          When someone is aware of what is normal or not but is unsure of what
          to do next or what is abnormal and why it occurs, they wind up paying
          a lot of money to doctors as well as giving a significant amount of
          time.
          <br />
          <br />
          So, here we are proposing a solution to the above problem by
          developing a Smart Report system. Patientâ€™s sample will be collected
          at the lab, then the sample will be processed. The patient after
          receiving the report will be able to generate smart diagnostic report.
